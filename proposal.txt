Virtual File exploration

I  would like to make the digital world a little more physical.
The ability to open every file and have them persist in view.


walkthrough

open to the room with single point of interest a file list off a little bit
away. Always there in that location in the room as the rock of the simulation.
Selecting a folder pulls a folder into your hand.
throwing the folder opens the contents automaticly or files can be cycled
through.
Droping the folder closes everything and the folder can be placed to keep it
open and do something else.

The program should be able to open text and images with the posibility that it
might be able to open particular types of structured data.
